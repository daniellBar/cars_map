## Overview
Server is written in nodeJS and ExpressJs. It has two endpoints as was asked but requests are being made only to one.  
  Client is written in React. it uses Google Map and Axios for http calls.
  It has a very simple UI of map and a list, it is responsive.   
  no pagination on server or client side (thought about adding it but had no time for it and was not requested)
